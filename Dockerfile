# H-3: clones the H-2 recipe which clones the H-1 pioneer recipe (see
# `xynes-infra/docs/plans/2026-05-13-mvp-release-stories/group-H-dockerfile-prod-targets.md`
# §"Landed implementation notes (2026-06-15)" + §"Landed implementation
# notes (2026-06-16)" for the deviation rationale).
#
# Stages
#   base  — pinned `oven/bun:1-alpine` by digest; shared install context.
#   dev   — bind-mount-friendly target for the local docker-compose dev
#           stack (already used by xynes-infra/docker-compose.dev.yml).
#   prod  — hardened runtime: non-root, no devDependencies, no test or
#           docs payload, no `.env*` files, HEALTHCHECK wired against
#           the H-3 /health route.
#
# Deviations from the canonical group-H skeleton (operator decision A,
# locked by H-1 — see AGENTS.md H-1 verification block):
#
#   1. Base image is `oven/bun:1-alpine`, NOT `oven/bun:1` (debian-slim).
#      Debian-slim lands the prod image at ~253 MB, blowing the
#      < 200 MB story budget. Alpine lands well under 150 MB. Bun's
#      binary is statically linked, so musl libc (alpine) vs glibc
#      (debian) is a no-op for our workload. Digest pinned to the H-1
#      multi-arch manifest digest so every H-* image picks up the same
#      alpine baseline + future bumps are coordinated.
#
#   2. No `build` stage. xynes-authz-service runs `src/index.ts`
#      directly through Bun's TS support — there is no compile/bundle
#      step. The `prod` stage installs full deps (verifies `bun.lock`),
#      discards them, reinstalls `--production`, and copies the source
#      tree. The TypeScript correctness gate runs in CI (group-M
#      `ci.yml`), NOT inside the Dockerfile (H-1-FU-1 follow-up).
#
#   3. The healthcheck script uses Bun's built-in fetch instead of
#      `curl`, so the image needs no extra `apk add curl` layer (smaller
#      attack surface + smaller image).
#
# Repo-specific notes
#   - Drizzle migrations live under `src/db/migrations/` (not a
#     top-level `drizzle/` directory). The `COPY src ./src` step in the
#     prod stage automatically ships them so `bun run migrate` can run
#     them on first boot.
#   - Entry point is `index.ts` at repo root, which re-exports
#     `src/index.ts`. We launch via `bun run src/index.ts` directly to
#     skip an indirection layer.
